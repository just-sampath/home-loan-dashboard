# Paydown

Paydown is a Vite + React dashboard for tracking a floating-rate home loan in INR. It models the current payoff path, rate revisions, part payments, and alternate what-if scenarios from a fixed EMI / tenure-reduction perspective.

## What It Tracks

- Dashboard summary for outstanding balance, months saved, interest saved, current rate, and next EMI.
- Month-by-month amortization schedule with rate-change and prepayment markers.
- Editable floating-rate revisions and part payments, persisted in `localStorage`.
- What-if scenarios that layer hypothetical rate changes and prepayments over the current loan.
- Theme and palette preferences, also persisted locally.

## Calculation Model

The loan engine lives in `src/features/loan/loanEngine.ts`. It uses the reducing-balance EMI formula, keeps EMI constant after rate changes or part payments, and shortens or extends tenure based on the resulting balance. The calculation audit and source notes are in `docs/calculations.md`.

Default loan data is configured in `src/config/loan.config.ts`:

- Principal: INR 30,00,000
- Original annual rate: 8.70%
- Original tenure: 180 months
- Start date: 2024-09-01

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite 8
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Recharts
- Vitest + jsdom
- Bun for dependency installation and scripts

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Run the app checks:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
bun run preview
```

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Start Vite on `127.0.0.1`. |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type-check app and Vite config projects. |
| `bun run build` | Type-check, then build static assets into `dist`. |
| `bun run test` | Run Vitest tests. |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint with zero warnings allowed. |
| `bun run format` | Format source, root config, and docs files with Prettier. |
| `bun run format:check` | Check formatting without writing changes. |
| `bun run deploy` | Legacy local `gh-pages` branch deploy path. The GitHub Actions workflow below is the preferred Pages deployment. |

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This repo includes `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` for GitHub Pages deployment through GitHub Actions. The workflow is built for this project rather than the npm example pattern:

- It uses `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2` because the repo has `bun.lock`.
- It installs with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
- It runs lint, tests, and the Vite production build before deployment.
- It uploads the Vite `dist` directory as the Pages artifact.
- It deploys through the `github-pages` environment with the required Pages/OIDC permissions.

The Vite base path is already set in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
base: process.env.BASE_PATH ?? '/home-loan-dashboard/';
```

That matches the default project Pages URL:

```text
https://<owner>.github.io/home-loan-dashboard/
```

If this repo is deployed as an organization/user Pages site, or behind a custom domain at the domain root, set `BASE_PATH=/` in the workflow and update `vite.config.ts` defaults if needed.

### GitHub Repository Setup

1. Push this repository to GitHub on the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, open `Settings` -> `Pages`.
3. Under `Build and deployment`, set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.
4. Push to `main` or run the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow manually from the Actions tab.

No `gh-pages` branch is required for this workflow.

### Deployment Research Notes

The workflow follows GitHub's current custom Pages workflow model:

- GitHub Pages can publish from a custom GitHub Actions workflow instead of a branch source.
- The expected flow is checkout, build static files, upload the static output with `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, then deploy it with `actions/deploy-pages`.
- `actions/configure-pages` supplies Pages metadata and static-generator support.
- The deploy job needs `pages: write` and `id-token: write` permissions, should depend on the build job, and should target the `github-pages` environment.
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact` handles the Pages artifact packaging requirements and defaults the artifact name to `github-pages`.
- For Bun projects, `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2` is the setup action used before `bun install`.
